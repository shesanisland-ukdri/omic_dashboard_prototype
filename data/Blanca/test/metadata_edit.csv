1. Description of methods used for collection/generation of data: ,2. Methods for processing the data: ,3. Instrument- or software-specific information needed to interpret the data: 
Mice were injected with either astrocyte-TurboID or astrocyte-tdTomato AAV. Each mouse received 3 doses of biotin (24 mg/kg) over 24 hours. All mice also received a single injection of PBS (24 mg/kg) 24 hours before culling,Raw files were analyzed with DIANN software (1.8.1) using the following parameters:,Mass spec: Bruker TIMS-TOF SCP
Mice were culled by cervical dislocation and cortex hemispheres were dissected and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples were stored at -80C until proteins were isolated.,Spectra were analysed with library-free DIA (double-pass) using a Uniprot mouse FASTA file that included tdTomato and streptavidin and a library of known contaminants for in-silico digest,Analysis Software: DIANN and custom analyses in R
Biotinylated proteins from the cortex were isolated using streptavidin coated beads.,"""report.pg_matrix"" file from DIANN output containing protein quantifications was used for downstream analysis",
Isolated biotinylated proteins were digested into peptides via on-bead digestion with trypsin+Lys-C.,Custom R script was used to clean up the data:,
10% of each isolated peptide sample was injected into the mass spec.,"a. Removed ambiguous proteins (contains "";"" in Protein.Group)",
,b. Dropped proteins without a gene name,
,"c. Removed keratins, other cRAP (https://www.thegpm.org/crap/), and non-mouse proteins by searching against custom library of Crap_IDs",
,d. Excluded proteins found in 2 or fewer samples (irrespective of AAV),
,e. Normalised proteins by quantile normalisation.,
,"f. All NA values (i.e., no protein detected) were imputed as 0 for differential expression analysis",
